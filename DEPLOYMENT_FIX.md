# Deployment Fix for Render

## Problem
The build was failing with a prerender error because the loginpage was trying to access browser-only APIs (localStorage, searchParams) during server-side rendering.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Client-Side Only Code
- Added `mounted` state to prevent hydration mismatches
- Wrapped localStorage calls with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks
- Added try-catch for searchParams to handle SSR errors
- Added loading states until components are mounted

### 2. Environment Variables for Production
- Updated API and Socket URLs to use environment variables
- Created `.env.example` with required variables

### 3. Files Modified
- `app/loginpage/page.tsx` - Fixed localStorage and searchParams issues
- `app/studentpage/page.tsx` - Fixed localStorage issues and added mounting check
- `lib/api.ts` - Made API URL configurable via environment variables
- `lib/socket.ts` - Made Socket URL configurable via environment variables
- Created `app/loginpage/loading.tsx` for better loading UX

## Deployment Steps for Render

### Frontend Deployment:
1. **Environment Variables in Render Dashboard:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-service.onrender.com/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-service.onrender.com
   ```

2. **Build Command:** `npm run build`
3. **Start Command:** `npm start`

### Backend Deployment:
1. **Update CORS origins** in your backend to include your frontend URL
2. **Environment Variables** for database connection
3. **Build Command:** `npm install`
4. **Start Command:** `npm start`

## Local Development
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Update URLs if needed for local development
3. Default values will work for standard local setup

The build should now complete successfully without prerender errors!
